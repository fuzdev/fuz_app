 *
 * Cross-process suite modules (which drive a separately-spawned backend binary
 * over HTTP) need only the wire path / role / fixture-URL, not the in-process
 * route handlers. Importing them from `default_spine_surface.ts` used to drag
 * its eager `account_routes.ts` / `signup_routes.ts` imports — and through them
 * `session_middleware` → `hono/cookie` — onto a backend-spawning consumer with
 * no `hono` peer installed (a Rust-only spine consumer). Keeping these constants
 * on this handler-free leaf lets such a consumer import the path without the
 * peer. `default_spine_surface.ts` re-exports them for in-process callers.
